"Skeleton auto-configuration works by recording movement data and simulating "

"adjusting bone lengths, the algorithm measures the amount the feet slide to "
"know whether it's achieving a better or worse outcome with each adjustment. "

"The Wemos D1 Mini is an ESP8266 dev board, it's basically a small computer "

"There are multiple variants of the D1 Mini, some better than others. The "
"main variants you should look at purchasing would be the CH340, V3.0, and "
"V4.0. There are, however, variants you should avoid. These would be the "
"FT232, and Pro variants. The FT232 variant may have USB connectivity issues "
"due to fake FT232 chips, and the Pro variant has a design flaw with its "

"Straps are another area where you have a lot of liberty to try whatever "

"stretch and should stay in place however you move. Nylon straps, while "
"technically usable, are fairly inflexible will tend to slide as you move, "
"making them less suitable. Generally speaking, you will want straps that are "
"at least 38mm or 1.5 inches wide, going any smaller will result in less "
"stable mounting."
msgstr ""

#: src/diy/components-guide.md:104

"When it comes to mounting, you may find that there are not any straps long "
"enough to go around your torso -- in this case, two straps with velcro can "
"be chained together to make one longer strap. Another option for the chest "
"in particular is to use a GoPro chest mount, which can improve stability "
"greatly if you find your chest trackers tend to slide. Also, its worth "
"mentioning that you may want different sized straps depending on where each "
"tracker is going to go, such as having shorter straps for thigh trackers "
"than ankle trackers. Be sure to measure yourself with a tape measure if "
"you're going to go this route! It's worth noting that *elastic stretches* so "

"additional 50mm or so or more depending on length."

"Often things made of steel or other ferromagnetic materials contribute most "

"affect your magnetic environment include, but are not limited to: spring "
"mattresses, radiators, PC cases, desktop speakers, or furniture that's made "
"of steel. In most cases, the effect that these things will have extend about "
"6-12 inches (15-30 cm) and within that range may cause the IMU to rotate "
"incorrectly. The size and amount of mass directly impacts the size of the "
"effected area; a paper clip might only affect your IMU if it's directly next "
"to it, whereas a steel bedframe might affect an area 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) "
"away as previous mentioned. In most cases, depending on the size of your "
"playspace, these issues of certain objects causing interference can be "
"mitigated by avoiding or reposition them. Regardless, other factors such as "
"the wiring or rebar in your building could also affect your magnetic "
"environment. These last few examples are harder to predict and illustrate "

"## Why choose L,i,me?\n"
"- Unlike the standard set up that is limited to **2 IMUs** per tracker, each "
"**L,i,me** tracker supports **4 IMUs** (without any software modification). "
"Due to this you only need to make 3 L,i,me trackers instead of 6 typical "
"slime trackers for a full 9 IMU setup.\n"
"- Less parts required, making L,i,me the cheapest full 9 IMU setup (as well "
"as 13 IMU setup with optional addon).\n"
"- Aimed at providing the best stable tracking with comfort and full "
"maneuverability due to being less bulky overall (less main trackers).\n"
"- Only need to charge and maintain 3 trackers (4 if you include the optional "
"addon).\n"
"- Modular and customisable.\n"
